There are many essential factors to consider developing or modifying a logistics or distribution material-handling system, such as:
 The material being handled The required environment (cooler, freezer, etc.) The volume and speed of movement The type of facility required The type of equipment required &amp;hellip;  This is a summary of practical and useful guide to material-handling problems developed by the College-Industry Council on Material Handling Education.</description>
